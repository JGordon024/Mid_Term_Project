  <h1>My Skill Sets</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I possess many desirable traits that will prove useful in my line of work. For starters, when coding I use
      logical and critical thinking.
      I think around problems and find solutions effectively and effeciently. In addition, over the years of my
      education, I've learned how
      to deal with complex problem solving. I can identify and evaluate problems and review relative information on it.
      I'm constantly
      learning, improving on myself and my techniques with every website I code. I'm always gaining a new understanding
      of current and future
      situations and decision making skills. During my time learning the different languages of website developemet, I
      have grasped a very strong
      understanding of the systems associated with it. I've come to understand how these systems change based off of
      the conditions, enviroments,
      and operations and the outcomes that will come. Furthermore, I graduated with high grades during my highschool
      years, averaging out a 4.0 GPA,
      which I only achieved through my hard work and dedication.</p>
