    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>To obtain a better understanding of who I am, it's best to know where I come from and who I am as a person. I
      was raised in Phoenix, Arizona and went to Sweetwater Elementary School. From third grade up until 10th, I was a
      runner. I spent a lot of time training, and dedicated myself to trying to constantly improve. I always try to go
      beyond my limits and further improve myself. However, academics always came first. In 11th grade, as a Junior, I
      was accepted to go into West-Mec, which is an advanced school that teaches different college level education to
      prepare students to enter the work force. It was there that I first begun my studies for Website Development.</p>
    <h2>Where I plan on going</h2>
    <p>All that I've accomplished and what I've done don't stop there though. I have much more planned for myself in
      the near future. For the next while, I'm going to be pursuing the beauty of Web Development. However, I do plan
      on going to college to further expand my education. Then, I'm also looking into entering the game development
      market and get a degree for that while going to College.</p>
